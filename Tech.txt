Compressed data is corrupted in XP because of code:

	Winsock1.getData data, bytesTotal - 1 

We added the - 1 because 98 seems to add an extra byte to the data.
Removed the - 1 in XP because decompression was failing with "Z_DATA_ERROR"
meaning the data was corrupt.

It HAD to be somewhere in the transmission, so the logical choice was in DataArrival.
Need to test once more under windows 98.

Funny.

It was working with bytesTotal - 1 before, now it works without it.
